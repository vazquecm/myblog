    <h3>What Was I Thinking?!?</h3>

      <p class="indent">Okay, so really...what am I thinking?  Well to be honest, I have no IDEA!!  Been a surgical nurse for about 20 years and now I just up and change careers.  Crazy, I know!  Sometimes you just have to do something different to find the "joy" in working again.  So here I am...a student..a freshman in the computer world!</p>

      <p class="indent">At least I don't have to wear scrubs anymore and can actually wear some of the clothes that have been sitting in my closet all these years.</p>
    
    <h3>Becoming a Web Developer</h3>
     <p class="indent">Please don't ask me why I picked this field cause I haven't really got an answer.  Saw an article in the newspaper and pondered for a couple of months before actually applying to school.  So at least no one can say I am being to impulsive changing careers.  Besides, I take care of my parents and this can turn into something that I can do from home and still make a decent living.  Someone has got to pay the bills!!</p>

    <h3>Becoming a <span><a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/freshman"</span>Freshman</a>...Again.</h3>
           <p>I am now the freshman in my house.  My son finds this concept extremely amusing, especially since he his graduating in May from Father Ryan.  All I can do is laugh and shake my head at him. While I am learning to code apps and the web, Raphael wants to become a graphic designer.  Perhaps one day we will work together.</p>
